# GoLand Project

This project is a collection of Go programs demonstrating various concepts in the Go programming language.

## Concepts Covered
- Data Types and Memory Allocation
- Static vs Dynamic Typing
- User Input Handling
- Variable Declarations and Constants
- Type Conversion and Casting
- Control Flow (loops, conditional statements, break/continue, defer, panic)
- Error Handling
- Arithmetic, Comparison, Logical, and Bitwise Operators
- Complex Data Types (arrays, slices, maps, structs)
- Functions (variadic, recursive, anonymous, higher-order, deferred)
- Closures
- Methods
- Interfaces

## Files
- `01datatypes/main.go`: Demonstrates data types in Go, including primitive types, complex types, and memory allocation.
- `02variables/main.go`: Demonstrates variable declarations, constants, type conversion, and casting.
- `03userInput/main.go`: Demonstrates handling user input.
- `04operators/main.go`: Demonstrates the use of arithmetic, comparison, logical, and bitwise operators.
- `05controlflow/main.go`: Demonstrates control flow mechanisms like loops, conditional statements, break/continue, defer, and panic.
- `06complexdatatypes/main.go`: Demonstrates complex data types in Go, such as arrays, slices, maps, and structs.
- `07functions/main.go`: Demonstrates various types of functions in Go, including variadic, recursive, anonymous, higher-order, and deferred functions. Also covers closures.
- `08pointers/main.go`: Demonstrates the concept of pointers in Go.
- `09structs/main.go`: Demonstrates the concept of structs in Go.
- `10methods/main.go`: Demonstrates the concept of methods in Go, including methods with value and pointer receivers.
- `11interfaces/main.go`: Demonstrates the concept of interfaces in Go, including implicit interface implementation.

## Running the Programs
