# GoLand Project

This project is a collection of Go programs demonstrating various concepts in the Go programming language.

## Concepts Covered
- Data Types and Memory Allocation
- Static vs Dynamic Typing
- User Input Handling
- Variable Declarations and Constants
- Type Conversion and Casting
- Control Flow (loops, conditional statements, break/continue, defer, panic)
- Error Handling
- Arithmetic, Comparison, Logical, and Bitwise Operators

## Files
- `README.md`: This file.
- `01dataTypes/main.go`: Demonstrates data types and memory allocation in Go.
- `02variables/main.go`: Demonstrates variable declarations, constants, type conversion, and casting.
- `03userInput/main.go`: Demonstrates handling user input.
- `04operators/main.go`: Demonstrates the use of arithmetic, comparison, logical, and bitwise operators.
- `05controlflow/main.go`: Demonstrates control flow mechanisms like loops, conditional statements, break/continue, defer, and panic.

## Running the Programs
To run any program, navigate to its directory and run `go run main.go`.
